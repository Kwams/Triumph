                <h2>Triumph in Life Inc.</h2>
                <p>Triumph in Life, Inc. was founded in 2008 by a then-public school teacher who saw the need for mentoring and other enrichment activities for her “high-functioning” students who had severe academic deficits students.</p>
                <p>It was her vision to create a continuum of academic, mentoring, and awareness programs that would meet the needs of her students by filling in the gaps left by traditional schools that have not lived up to the promise of No Child Left Behind.</p>
                <p>After serving deserving students with high-quality mentoring and educating parents, teachers, and school leaders on best practices for educating students with specific learning disabilities, in 2014 Triumph in Life, Inc. started Triumph Transitions Institute, now known as Triumph School.</p>
                <p>As a result of the pandemic, and the realization of the impact on all students, in 2023 Triumph in Life, Inc. is launching Triumph on Wheels, an innovative way to bring educational services to students via the use of a bus to remediate academic deficits and improve reading and math skills for students in grades 4t - 8th in South Cobb and South Fulton. This program is open to all students and continues the continuum of services to students meeting them where they are.
